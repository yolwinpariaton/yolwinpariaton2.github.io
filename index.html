            <h2>Chart 3: Fertility Rate Comparison - Peru and Chile</h2>
            <p>This chart shows the dramatic decline in fertility rates for Peru and Chile from 1960 to 2023. Both countries experienced significant demographic transitions, with Peru starting from a higher peak of around 6.9 children per woman in the 1960s, while Chile began at approximately 5.5. The convergence of these rates over time reflects similar socioeconomic development patterns across Latin America.</p>
